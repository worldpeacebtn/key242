# Achieving Milestone: Adding Blogs Section

Finally! The day has come. The stars have aligned, the code has compiled, and I have successfully added a blog section to my portfolio. It's a small step for a developer, but a giant leap for my procrastination.

## The Journey

It started with a simple thought: "I should have a blog." That thought was immediately followed by a year of overthinking the design, 3 months of debating between a CMS and Markdown, and 2 weeks of actually writing code.

### Why Space Theme?

Because why not? If I'm going to write about code, I might as well do it while floating in the void of the internet. Plus, dark mode is default in space.

## What to Expect?

- **Tech Rants**: Opinions on frameworks I barely use.
- **Tutorials**: How to center a div (spoiler: use flexbox).
- **Life Updates**: Mostly about how much coffee I consumed.

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for more content. Or don't. I'm just happy this page renders without errors. 🚀
